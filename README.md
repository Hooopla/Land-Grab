## Game Description
Land Grab is a **3 player** grid based game where players will have to compete against one another by claiming the region with the most cells. Each game, the gameboard is randomized and divided into three distinct regions, each with a different amount of cells. Once the round starts, players must rush to choose a region to claim. Once a region is claimed, it becomes locked, which then prevents other players from selecting it. When everyone has made their selection or time runs out the game will then choose the winner by selecting the player with the largest region. 

⚠️ NOTE: If one or more players do not choose a region in time, the round will reset! ⚠️
